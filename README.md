# Disaster-Relief-Fund-Allocation

Sometimes, it might be the case where homeowners might get extra money from their insurance or because of fraud, which meant they end up with more funds from the Road Home program than they should which became the need to identify to save the funds from improper allocations.
Here our task is to identify which homes/homeowners or might be the contractor in the state of Louisiana got more money than they were supposed to so we can make sure the money is used properly, shared fairly, and disaster recovery programs work better in a future scenario.
Also looking to the extensive-data it could by doing the exploratory data analysis of the acquired data we can try to identify the numbers which could have been saved at first if the frauds were detected before the disbursement of the grant leading to extensive help to other homeowners.
