# Disaster-Relief-Fund-Allocation

## Introduction and Background 
After hurricanes Katrina and Rita affected the state of Louisiana in 2005, the Road Home Program was established to aid Louisiana homeowners whose properties suffered extensive damage beyond what insurance and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Association) assistance covered. This initiative provided various grants, such as compensation, elevation, and mitigation grants. The dataset acquired from the Louisiana Division of Administration contains detailed records of property owners who received these grants, including information on pre-storm property values, repair costs, insurance details, and total grant amounts disbursed.

Discrepancies in grant amounts have been observed due to factors like additional insurance payments or instances of fraud, affecting the actual funds owed by property owners to the state. Identifying properties that received more than the actual grant amount is essential for ensuring financial transparency, fair resource allocation, and enhancing program effectiveness.


## Problem Statement
Sometimes, it might be the case where homeowners might get extra money from their insurance or because of fraud, which meant they end up with more funds from the Road Home program than they should which became the need to identify to save the funds from improper allocations.
Here our task is to identify which homes/homeowners or might be the contractor in the state of Louisiana got more money than they were supposed to so we can make sure the money is used properly, shared fairly, and disaster recovery programs work better in a future scenario.
Also looking to the extensive-data it could by doing the exploratory data analysis of the acquired data we can try to identify the numbers which could have been saved at first if the frauds were detected before the disbursement of the grant leading to extensive help to other homeowners.
